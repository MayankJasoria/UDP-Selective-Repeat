# UDP Selective Repeat

This repository contains code to simulate the selective repeat protocol of pipelined packet transmission between a client and a server over the network. In this system, there is a server and a client, where the client requests for a file (input.txt) from the server. For each packet of data that the client receives from the server, it sends an appropriate acknowledgement to the server which specifies the last in-sequence byte received by the client. The communication occurs via two relays, such that each relay is made to randomly drop some packets sent from the server to the client to mimic packet loss occurring over the network. However, for simplicity, the acknowledgement packets are never dropped.
